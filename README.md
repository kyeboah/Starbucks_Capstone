# Starbucks Capstone Project
## Project Overview
The Starbucks Capstone Project aims to analyse customer behavior in response to various marketing offers. By leveraging customer profiles, transactional data, and details of marketing offers, this project seeks to build a machine learning model to predict how customers will respond to different types of offers. This predictive capability enables Starbucks to optimise their promotional strategies for better customer engagement and satisfaction.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective is to predict customer responses to marketing offers. Accurate predictions will help Starbucks tailor their marketing strategies to maximize effectiveness and customer satisfaction. The project involves building a machine learning model that classifies whether a customer will respond to an offer based on their profile and historical interaction data.

## Data Sources

The dataset consists of three main files:
* portfolio.json: Contains details about each offer (type, difficulty, reward, duration, and channels).
* profile.json: Contains demographic information about customers (age, income, gender, and membership start date).
* transcript.json: Contains records of customer interactions with the offers (when offers were received, viewed, and completed).

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**
Profile Data: Analyze demographic information and handle missing values.
Portfolio Data: Understand the types of offers and their distributions.
Transcript Data: Extract meaningful features from customer interaction records.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
**Imputation**: Replace missing values in age, income, and gender.
**Encoding**: One-hot encode categorical variables (offer type, gender, age group).
**Normalisation**: Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
**Feature Engineering**: Create new features like membership duration and transform date features.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
**Model Selection**: Test several models including KNeighborsClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier.
**Training**: Split data into training and testing sets and train models using the training set.
**Evaluation**: Evaluate models using accuracy and F1 score on the test set.
**Feature Importance**: Analyze the importance of each feature in the final model.
4. **Results and Analysis**
The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved high accuracy and F1 score.
Feature importance analysis revealed that money gained, social channels, and time significantly impact customer responses.
5. **Conclusion and Future Work**
The project successfully developed a model to predict customer responses to marketing offers.
Future improvements include collecting more data, experimenting with additional feature engineering techniques, and implementing advanced models like deep learning.
